# ATM-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
ATM Management System (Python)

The ATM Management System is a Python-based console application that simulates the basic operations of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and class methods.

The system allows users to securely access their bank account using a PIN and perform common banking operations like checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money (with a defined limit), and viewing transaction history.

🔹 Features :

PIN-based user authentication (3 attempts limit)

Check account balance

Deposit money

Withdraw money with a maximum withdrawal limit

Transaction history tracking

Transaction count monitoring

Uses abstract classes for structure and scalability

Console-based interactive menu

🔹 OOP Concepts Used :

Abstraction: Implemented using the ABC module and abstract methods

Inheritance: ATM class inherits from BankAccount and Account

Encapsulation: Private and protected variables for sensitive data

Class Methods: Used to display bank information

🔹 Technologies Used :

Python 3

Standard Python libraries (abc)

🔹 Purpose :

This project is designed for learning and educational purposes, helping beginners understand how real-world ATM systems work while practicing Python programming and OOP principles.

If you want, I can also:

Write a README.md file

Add usage instructions

Improve variable names or code structure

Make it more resume or college-project friendly
